## About Dataset

Data Overview: This data file is a Comma separated value file format with 2290 rows and 7 columns. It contains 5 columns which are numerical in datatype and one column in Date format. Clearly the data shows value of the variables SPX,GLD,USO,SLV,EUR/USD against the dates in the date column.

## Algorithm Used: Random Forest Regressor

**What is Random Forest Regression?**

Random Forest is an ensemble technique capable of performing both regression and classification tasks with the use of multiple decision trees and a technique called Bootstrap and Aggregation, commonly known as bagging. The basic idea behind this is to combine multiple decision trees in determining the final output rather than relying on individual decision trees. 

Random Forest has multiple decision trees as base learning models. We randomly perform row sampling and feature sampling from the dataset forming sample datasets for every model. This part is called Bootstrap.
